## Hello there

#### About Me
I'm a final year BSc. Applied Maths and Computer Science Major at the University of South Africa, but before that I studied 3D animation and Game Design as well as worked as a senior marketer and Web Designer.

I spend my time learning new ideas, playing video games, reading books, learning more about programming, or watching a new show or movie.

I am currently working on improving my skills in C++, and Web Design by getting my personal website set up. I am also teaching myself Rust and the Godot Game Engine.

The university I am studying at is a correspondence which means while I have a sylabus to follow, I have had to teach myself everything for the courses (effectively self-taught with a degree at the end.)

#### Experience and Knowledge
1 year experience in Web Design and marketing.

1 and a half years experience in game design and 3D animation.

2 years experience in graphic design.

3 years experience in software development (from studying at the University of South Africa.)

##### Skills
1. C++
2. Problem solving
3. Client relations
4. Web design
5. Team communication
