## Hello there

I am a British South-African programmer currently unable to work on projects outside of my personal projects and specific commercial projects. I also have experience in higher-level mathematics from my degree, as well as some experience in 3D animation and Game Design.  

If you like any project, or template I have been working on, please tell me about what you are working on, I would love to check it out.

### Website
https://grahamhill.dev


##### Current Projects
I tend to work on small projects that help build up towards larger complicated projects, if I think someone else might get use of my test projects I release them so you can reference them if you are stuck on a problem I might have a solution to.  
- A Game Engine/Framework using [DearImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)
- Experiments with a plugin based architecture in C++
- My Website
- GameJams on [itch.io](https://grahamhill.itch.io/)
- Experiments with Multithreading and Quantum Computing
- Text to Speech applications

###### Non-Code Based Projects
I also tend to work on non-code based projects that can be seen on my website, or at least reached from there (if you want to see them.) 

### Experience in the following
- C++
- CMake
- Php (with Laravel and Wordpress.)
- JavaScript (Specifically with Three.js and Vue.js)
- GNU Octave
- Python (Mostly just fun experiments.)
- Mathematical Modeling
- Numerical Methods
