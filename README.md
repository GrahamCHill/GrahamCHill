## 💫 About Me

Backend & Systems Engineer with a background in **Applied Mathematics and Computer Science**, specialising in **distributed systems, infrastructure reliability, and correctness-critical software**.

I design backend systems that behave predictably under **real load, partial failure, and long-term operation**. My work centres on **explicit invariants, failure modelling, capacity planning, and post-incident redesign**, rather than patching symptoms.

I routinely own systems end-to-end—from early design and trade-off analysis through production operation—establishing **clear interfaces, deterministic processing paths, and auditable state transitions**.

I bring strong **systems programming depth in C++**, which informs how I reason about concurrency, latency, memory, and failure modes in distributed environments.

**Focus:** distributed systems · infrastructure reliability · system design  
**Strengths:** correctness & auditability · production ownership · failure modelling
